# Personal Profile Page (HTML Only)

This project is a simple personal profile webpage built using only HTML, as part of a mini-project assessment.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to demonstrate the ability to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements without relying on CSS or JavaScript for styling or interactivity.

## Features

* **Header Section:**
    * Includes a page title ("My Profile").
    * Contains a basic navigation menu with links to "About Me," "Hobbies," and "Contact." (Note: These are placeholders and do not link to actual pages.)
* **Bio Section:**
    * A short personal introduction.
    * Includes a placeholder image (you should replace this with your own image).
* **Hobbies/Interests Section:**
    * An unordered list displaying at least three hobbies or interests.
* **Footer Section:**
    * Displays basic contact information (email and social media handle).

## Technologies Used

* HTML5 (Semantic HTML elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`)
